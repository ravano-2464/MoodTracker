# MoodTracker Android App

**OpenClassrooms Project 6: Android MoodTracker App**

 The idea is simple: every day, you record your mood within the application. if you want, you can add a note to give more information on  _why_  you're feeling a certain way (ex. "I got a new job! ðŸ˜ƒ" or "There was no cheesecake left for dessert ðŸ˜ž ").

Your mood history is saved for a week, allowing you see your general mood trends. Any comment you've left can also be consulted.
